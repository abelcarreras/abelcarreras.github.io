This is a text with the equation :math:`3 Â· 3^2 + \Omega_2` in the middle.
Just start with "(:)math(:)" clausule and write the equation in LateX format between "`".

This another text with an equation in the next paragraph.

.. math::
    \Omega = 3 + 4

You can define a label for the equation so you can cite later:

.. math:: e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
   :label: euler


The equation get a number and you can it cite as :eq:`euler`, and continue writting. Also you get an atomatic link to the equation.
