Websites (group & community seminars)
-------------------------------------
Our Group and Community Seminars websites are based in jekyll ( https://jekyllrb.com ).
To update these sites it is necessary to be included ans a contributor in the corresponding
GitHub repository, clone the repository in your local machine, modify the code and push the changes
back to the repository. For more information check git documentation ( https://git-scm.com/doc ).
There exist many graphical tools to facilitate this process (e.g. https://desktop.github.com )

To test the website in your local machine you can use the following commands:

Serve jekyll based website in local ::

    bundle exec jekyll serve

Compile jekyll based website ::

    bundle exec jekyll build
