.. note::
    Now OpenBabel +2.3.x library should be compiled from source (https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel)

.. note::
    On macOS 10.15+ (Catalina+) openGL became semi-unsupported and present some issues.
    To solve them, *info.plist* file placed in Avogadro.app/Contents/ should be changed
    as follows (https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3/issues/422#issuecomment-541193050) ::

    <key>NSHighResolutionCapable</key>
    <false/>
